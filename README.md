## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Customer Churn Prediction and Business Intelligence solution designed to identify customers at risk of leaving a telecom company and provide actionable business insights.

The project combines SQL, Python, Machine Learning, and Power BI to analyze customer behavior, predict churn probability, and visualize business insights through interactive dashboards.

The objective of this project is to:

* Analyze customer churn patterns
* Identify key churn drivers
* Predict future churn customers
* Provide business recommendations to improve customer retention

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Findings

* Total Customers: 7,043
* Churn Rate: 26.54%
* Retention Rate: 73.46%
* Average Tenure (Retained Customers): 37.57 Months
* Average Tenure (Churned Customers): 17.98 Months
* Average Monthly Charges (Retained Customers): $61.27
* Average Monthly Charges (Churned Customers): $74.44

### Insights

* Customers with lower tenure are more likely to churn.
* Customers paying higher monthly charges show higher churn rates.
* Month-to-month contracts experience significantly higher churn.
* Contract type strongly influences customer retention.
